# Duchamp Essential

This branch adapts Rodin Essential's native hardware-control application for
Xiaomi Duchamp and its MediaTek Dimensity 8300-Ultra platform.
It combines a zero-DEX Android `NativeActivity`, a Flutter AOT interface, a
Rust host runtime, and a separately privileged Rust daemon.

## Origin and credits

**Duchamp Essential is a device adaptation of [Rodin Essential](https://github.com/NEESCHAL-3/Rodin-Essential), originally created and maintained by [NEESCHAL-3](https://github.com/NEESCHAL-3).** The application architecture, interface, and substantial portions of the implementation originate from that project. This repository adds the MT6897 / Xiaomi Duchamp device port and its related build changes; it does not claim authorship of the original work.

The original in-app developer credit and links to NEESCHAL-3 are intentionally preserved.

The APK never runs as root, does not use the system UID, and does not request
privileged Android permissions. Kernel and vendor controls are owned by the
daemon and reached through authenticated local transports restricted to the
installed application UID.

## Supported target

- Device codename: `duchamp`
- SoC: MediaTek MT6897 / Dimensity 8300-Ultra
- CPU policies: `policy0` (4 cores, 480–2200 MHz), `policy4` (3 cores,
  400–3200 MHz), and `policy7` (1 core, 400–3350 MHz)
- GPU: Mali-G615 MC6 with a live 65-step 265–1400 MHz OPP table
- ABI: ARM64
- Android: API 31 or newer
- Kernel userspace: 16 KB page-compatible native binaries
- Vendor dependencies: Rodin touch and display AIDL services plus MediaTek GED

The daemon now derives GPU limits and GED OPP indices from the live kernel table
and discovers the Mali cooling device by type. The original installer and AOSP
policy remain upstream Rodin assets and are intentionally outside this port.

## Main features

- Four persistent GPU performance profiles with live hardware readback.
- Mali devfreq range, governor, GED boost, power-policy, and OPP controls.
- CPU core mask, independent cluster governors, and validated per-cluster
  minimum/maximum or sustained exact-lock controls sourced from the live kernel
  OPP table.
- UFS scheduler selection across every detected UFS logical unit.
- Touch profiles for 240 Hz native timing, 480 Hz native timing, and the
  original v1.18.0 one-millisecond Android output stream generated from the
  native 480 Hz source.
- Xiaomi touch/display AIDL integration, DT2W, color modes, expert calibration,
  sunlight mode, HDR/video controls, resolution, and density controls.
- ZRAM size, algorithm, swappiness, compaction, charging, and power telemetry.
- [System Colors](docs/SYSTEM_COLORS.md): Android Material You seed palettes,
  wallpaper reset, style previews, and capability-based native color readback
  without a HyperOS, ColorOS, or AOSP ROM-name allowlist.
- Daemon-owned persistence and background reassertion after boot, screen wake,
  vendor resets, app force-close, or removal from recents.
- Configurable in-app motion timing with native 120 Hz frame pacing.

## Performance profiles

| Profile | GPU range and governor | GED / power policy | CPU behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stock Balanced | Live hardware range, `simple_ondemand` | GED off, `coarse_demand` | Unchanged; controlled separately |
| Gaming Dynamic | 265–1400 MHz, `simple_ondemand` | GED on, `always_on` | Unchanged; controlled separately |
| Battery Saver | 265–601 MHz, `powersave` | GED off, `coarse_demand` | Unchanged; controlled separately |
| Extreme Beast | Fixed 1400 MHz, `performance`, DVFS off | GED on, `always_on` | Unchanged; controlled separately |

GPU profiles never modify CPU governors, CPU clock ranges, or CPU core state.
Vendor CPU and platform thermal services remain running in every mode. Gaming
Dynamic and Extreme Beast override the Mali cooling constraint and can still
cause extreme heat, rapid battery drain, instability, or an emergency hardware
shutdown.

Custom CPU ranges remain separate from GPU profiles and governors. While at
least one custom CPU range is active, the daemon selects Rodin's OEM
`thermal-nolimits` configuration so Xiaomi's userspace policy cannot replace an
exact lock with a lower ceiling. It keeps the thermal services alive, remembers
the configuration that was active beforehand, and restores it when the final
custom CPU range is reset.

## Integration choices

| Method | APK privilege | Backend | Persistence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AOSP ROM integration | Normal app UID | Root init daemon | `/data/system/rodin-essential/state.conf` |
| KernelSU Next or Magisk | Normal app UID | Root module daemon | `/data/adb/rodin-essential/state.conf` |
| Standalone APK | Normal app UID | None | Hardware controls unavailable |

For a ROM release, use the AOSP integration. It installs the APK and daemon in
`/product`, creates a dedicated app SELinux domain, restricts the control socket
to that domain, starts the daemon after boot, and restores saved state without a
root manager.

See [AOSP ROM integration](docs/ROM_INTEGRATION.md) for the complete maintainer
workflow and [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for runtime details.

## Build from source

Required tools:

- Linux host
- Flutter SDK and revision-matched Flutter engine checkout
- Rust toolchain with `aarch64-linux-android`
- Android SDK, platform 36, build-tools, and NDK r27 or newer
- JDK 17 or newer, `ninja`, `zip`, `unzip`, and standard ELF tools

Build the pinned engine once:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
./tools/build-flutter-engine.sh
```

Build without touching a connected device:

```bash
RODIN_BUILD_ONLY=1 ./build-and-install.sh
```

Output is written under `out/release/<timestamp>/`. The build verifies
Flutter analysis, ARM64 AOT output, zero DEX, APK signing, 16 KB ZIP alignment,
16 KB ELF segment alignment, and a content stamp covering the packaged Flutter
assets and ICU data. If no signing key is supplied, a stable development key is
created once under the ignored `out/signing/` directory and reused by later
local builds.

For release signing, set:

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/release.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=release \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
RODIN_BUILD_ONLY=1 ./build-and-install.sh
```

## Export for an AOSP tree

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/rom-app.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=rodin-essential \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
  ./tools/export-aosp-bundle.sh
```

The generated `dist/aosp/RodinEssential-<timestamp>/` directory contains the
APK, daemon, control client, `Android.bp`, init service, split product/vendor
SELinux policy, the APK public certificate used by the dedicated app-domain
mapping, and checksums. Keep the same private key for every ROM update; the
private key is never copied into the bundle.

To build, stage, and wire the integration into an existing ROM source tree in
one command, provide the Rodin product makefile and BoardConfig path:

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/rom-app.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=rodin-essential \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
  ./tools/integrate-aosp-rom.sh /absolute/path/to/aosp \
    device/xiaomi/rodin/device.mk \
    device/xiaomi/rodin/BoardConfig.mk
```

The helper creates `vendor/rodin-essential`, verifies the complete build, and
adds the two exact include lines only when absent. It refuses paths outside the
selected source tree and never replaces an existing integration directory.
Passing only the AOSP root keeps the previous stage-only behavior.

## KernelSU Next and Magisk module

For an existing rooted ROM, build the combined application and daemon module:

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/release.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=release \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
  ./tools/build-kernelsu-next-module.sh
```

Install the ZIP from KernelSU Next Manager or the Magisk app while Android is
running. The installer registers the bundled APK as an ordinary user app and
the module runs only the separate hardware daemon as root. No live SELinux
patch, system overlay, privileged-app conversion, or app-to-root socket rule is
used. The direct Unix transport uses `SO_PEERCRED`. ROMs that block cross-domain
Unix `connectto` use a root-privileged localhost port instead; the app first
proves from its own UID/SELinux context that low-port binding is denied, and the
daemon resolves the accepted client's UID from `/proc/net/tcp` before serving a
command. A daemon-initiated Unix path remains as a compatibility fallback.
Module Action reports which authenticated transport completed instead of
treating a root-only control-client ping as proof. The package uses `skip_mount`;
because it overlays no partition files, KernelSU does not require a metamodule.
Recovery installation is not supported.

Keep the signing key for every future module update. Android rejects an APK
update signed by a different certificate.

The same ZIP can also act as a temporary update layer over a ROM-native Rodin
Essential installation when that ROM APK uses the same signing certificate as
the release APK. The installer updates the app without clearing its data, the
module daemon reuses `/data/system/rodin-essential`, and native init is stopped
before the module daemon starts. Removing the module rolls the app back to the
ROM copy and restarts the native service. A differently signed ROM build is
rejected without uninstalling the app or deleting its data; that build must be
updated through its maintainer's OTA or original signing key.
