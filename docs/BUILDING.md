# Building and verification

## Host requirements

- Linux x86_64
- Flutter SDK on `PATH`
- A matching Flutter engine checkout
- Rust and the `aarch64-linux-android` target
- Android SDK with platform 36, current build-tools, and an NDK
- JDK 17 or newer
- `ninja`, `readelf`, `file`, `zip`, and `unzip`

Set `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` when the SDK is not at `$HOME/Android/Sdk`.

## Prepare Rust and Flutter

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
flutter pub get --directory ui/flutter
```

The custom embedder must use a Flutter engine built from the framework's pinned
engine revision. If the engine checkout is not under the Flutter SDK, point the
engine build script at it:

```bash
RODIN_FLUTTER_ENGINE_SRC=/absolute/path/to/engine/src \
  ./tools/build-flutter-engine.sh
```

The script installs ignored local artifacts at:

```text
runtime/flutter-engine/prebuilt/android-arm64/libflutter_engine.so
runtime/flutter-engine/prebuilt/android-arm64/icudtl.dat
```

For CI or machines that do not modify Flutter itself, use the official
prebuilt ARM64 embedder matching the active Flutter SDK instead of checking out
the complete engine source tree:

```bash
flutter precache --android
./tools/install-flutter-engine-prebuilt.sh
```

Both engine installation paths write an `engine.version` stamp. Application
builds reject a runtime whose stamp differs from the active Flutter SDK.

## Build the application and daemon

```bash
RODIN_BUILD_ONLY=1 ./build-and-install.sh
```

The output directory contains:

```text
Rodin-Essential.apk
host-cargo/aarch64-linux-android/release/rodin_daemon
host-cargo/aarch64-linux-android/release/rodin_ctl
apk-files.txt
```

Without `RODIN_BUILD_ONLY=1`, the script installs the APK on the connected
device and updates the development root-module backend. ROM release automation
should always use build-only mode or `tools/export-aosp-bundle.sh`.

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/build-mt6897.yml` builds only the MT6897 application and its
native runtime. It deliberately does not build a Magisk or KernelSU installer.
The workflow pins Flutter, installs Android platform 36/build-tools/NDK and the
Rust ARM64 target, downloads the matching official Flutter embedder, runs the
zero-DEX and 16 KB verification, and uploads these artifacts:

```text
Rodin-Essential.apk
rodin_daemon
rodin_ctl
apk-files.txt
SHA256SUMS
```

Manual and branch builds use a disposable development certificate unless these
repository secrets are configured: `RODIN_KEYSTORE_B64`, `RODIN_KEY_ALIAS`,
`RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS`, and `RODIN_KEY_PASS`. `RODIN_KEYSTORE_B64` is the base64
encoding of the complete JKS file. Reuse the same protected signing key for
update-compatible APKs; never commit it to the repository.

## Signing

An omitted `RODIN_KEYSTORE` creates a stable local development key at
`out/signing/rodin-essential-development.jks`. The ignored key is generated
once and reused so repeated local builds remain update-compatible. Nothing
under `android/package` contains private signing material.

Supply release credentials through environment variables:

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/release.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=release \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
RODIN_BUILD_ONLY=1 ./build-and-install.sh
```

AOSP exports require an explicit persistent key. The imported APK remains
presigned with that certificate, and the exported public PEM binds its exact
package name to the dedicated `rodin_app` domain. The private key remains with
the ROM maintainer.

## Local checks

Run before committing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p rodin-essential-daemon
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed ui/flutter/lib
(cd ui/flutter && flutter analyze)
bash -n build-and-install.sh
bash -n tools/build-flutter-engine.sh
bash -n tools/build-kernelsu-next-module.sh
bash -n tools/export-aosp-bundle.sh
bash -n tools/integrate-aosp-rom.sh
./tools/test-kernelsu-watchdog-lock.sh
./tools/test-root-module-contract.sh
./tools/test-aosp-integration.sh
git diff --check
```

The NativeActivity host intentionally links Android system libraries and is not
linked as a Linux test executable. `build-and-install.sh` cross-compiles it with
the Android NDK and verifies the resulting ARM64 shared object.

Build verification additionally checks:

- `classes*.dex` is absent.
- APK signature verification succeeds.
- ZIP entries satisfy 16 KB page alignment.
- Every native ELF LOAD segment has at least 16 KB alignment.
- Every Dart FFI lookup resolves to an exported ARM64 host symbol.
- Daemon and control binaries target ARM64 Android.
- The packaged runtime stamp covers every Flutter asset and `icudtl.dat`, so
  application updates cannot reuse an incompatible extraction cache.

## AOSP export

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/rom-app.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=rodin-essential \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
  ./tools/export-aosp-bundle.sh
```

The export fails rather than replacing an existing destination. Pass a new
absolute or relative destination as its first argument when required.

To build, stage, and wire the integration directly in an AOSP checkout:

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/rom-app.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=rodin-essential \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
  ./tools/integrate-aosp-rom.sh /absolute/path/to/aosp \
    device/xiaomi/rodin/device.mk \
    device/xiaomi/rodin/BoardConfig.mk
```

The helper adds the exact product and BoardConfig includes idempotently and
refuses files outside the selected tree. Pass only the AOSP root for stage-only
operation with no device-tree edits.

## KernelSU Next and Magisk module

```bash
RODIN_KEYSTORE=/absolute/path/release.jks \
RODIN_KEY_ALIAS=release \
RODIN_KEYSTORE_PASS='store-password' \
RODIN_KEY_PASS='key-password' \
  ./tools/build-kernelsu-next-module.sh
```

This builds the application and daemon together, then creates one ZIP for
KernelSU Next Manager and the Magisk app. The build validates module metadata,
shell syntax, the authenticated Unix/loopback IPC contract, the official APK signing
certificate, package/version/zero-DEX/16 KB alignment, ARM64 daemon binaries,
Android dynamic linker, archive contents, and checksum. It also rejects any
SELinux patch payload or system overlay in the resulting ZIP.

The module installs the bundled APK through Android's package manager as a
normal user application. It does not mount an APK into a system partition, so
KernelSU does not need a metamodule. Policies that block cross-domain Unix
sockets use the root-privileged localhost fallback, whose accepted client is
mapped to the installed package UID through the kernel TCP table. The module
neither patches live SELinux policy nor converts the APK into a privileged
application. A policy that already permits the direct connection may use it.
Installation from recovery is not supported.

On a ROM with native Rodin Essential integration, the module becomes an update
layer only when Android accepts the bundled APK as a signature-compatible
system-app update. At boot it stops the native init service, shares the native
state directory, and then starts the module daemon. Module removal uses
Android's targeted `uninstall-system-updates` command and restarts native init.
No partition file is replaced. Cross-signature native updates remain rejected
because bypassing Android's package identity would either fail package scanning
or require destructive app removal.

The builder requires a persistent `RODIN_KEYSTORE`; it never creates a
disposable module signing identity. Reuse the same key for all published module
versions so Android can update the bundled application without removing user
data.
